"""Subject classifier for council bills.

Multi-label keyword classifier. A bill can fall in 0..N of:
  tax | transportation | food_security | affordable_housing

Designed to be high-recall: match against title + raw_subject, case-insensitive,
word-boundary regex. Tune by editing the dictionaries below.
